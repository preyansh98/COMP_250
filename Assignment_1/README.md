# Project Description

An online command-line template of a marketplace that allows customers to add certain products to their basket, and then proceed to checkout. Price before and after tax is calculated per Quebec regularities, and factored into the receipt at checkout. This project mainly draws on principles of inheritance in Java. 

## Thoughts about this assignment

I thoroughly enjoyed this assignment; a marketplace demo is not only relevant but very portable to scale in today's world. This project really deepened my appreciation of Java and how OOP works so smoothly with certain objectives in mind.
